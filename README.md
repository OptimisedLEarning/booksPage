Top Section: A header (e.g., page title).
Middle Section: Form for inputs.
Bottom Section: Table to display data.
Divide the Page into Grid Areas

Use grid-template-areas to assign names to sections:
"header" for the title.
"form" for the form.
"table" for the data display.
Map the Design to Grid Areas

Place each part (form, table, header) in its specific grid area.
Example layout:
Header	Header	Header
Form	Form	Form
Table	Table	Table
Add Responsiveness

Use media queries to adjust grid sizes for smaller screens, ensuring everything fits well.
Step-by-Step Example: Using CSS Grid for Forms and Tables
Top Section: Header

A simple heading or title like "User Registration".
This can span across the full width of the page.
Middle Section: Form

Create a grid for the form itself:
One column for labels (e.g., "Name").
Another column for inputs (e.g., text boxes).
Bottom Section: Table

Use the table for showing data (e.g., user list).
Place it in a separate grid area below the form.
CSS Grid Advantages
Organized Layout: Divide your page cleanly into rows and columns.
Flexibility: Adjust how much space each section takes.
Responsive Design: Easily modify the layout for different screen sizes.
Separation of Concerns: Keep structure (HTML) and design (CSS) separate.

Define the Grid in your CSS:

Use grid-template-areas to name the sections.
Define the number of rows and columns.
Assign Areas to Elements:
